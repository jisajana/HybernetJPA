       Storing the JAva Object on the database as a ROW

       SavingsAccount saObj = new SavingsAccount(10,"Jack",5000); <-- OBJECT

       Address  addrObj1 = new Address("Sweet Home","West Avenue","NY","NY","US",45361, 10);
       Address  addrObj2 = new Address("My Home","East Avenue","NJ","NJ","US",85361, 10);

       OBJECTS IN JAVA ARE NOT ROWS
       ROWS IN DATABASE ARE NOT OBJECTS

       to persist saObj, addrObj1, addrObj2
       we have to write insert queries

       WHAT IS THE SYNTAX AND NATURE OF THESE QUERIES

       insert into SAVINGS_ACCOUNT          values (?,?,?)
       insert into SAVINGS_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS  values (?,?,?)
       <--------->                          <------------>


       worldwide thousands of developers would write the same insert queries
       WHAT WOULD DIFFER IS THE TABLE NAMES AND THE COLUMNS AND THEIR COUNT

       is it applicable to other quries too?
       YES!!!

       update
       delete
       select
       select within select
       select with join queries


       WE NEED SOME AUTOMATION FOR THIS!!!!!!!!

                |
                JAVA APPLICATION [YOU NEED NOT WRITE JDBC BOILER PLATE CODE ]


             WHAT YOU NEED IS JPA LIBRARIES

         Initially this was used as an internal project by a team
         - Hibernate <-- framework is launched <-- own set of libraries

            ORM <-- Object Relational Mapping
                    |       |           |
                  java  dbTables        association

               JPA is to standardise these libraries
